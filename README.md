# PyKern
Terminal OS made on Python for fun. Main package manager is SIP (Super Installer Package).

# Super Installer Package
Use S.I.P. to install and uninstall packages
If you so ever happen to fail at any circumstances, download [PyKern-SIP](https://github.com/Kiffolisk/pykern-sip/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) (not necessary, will install all available packages) and [PyKern-Setup](https://github.com/Kiffolisk/pykern-setup/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract them to the same folder where your PyKern is installed




# Installing the packages needed
You can use pkginstaller.py to install the packages needed for PyKern to work!

# Editing the source code
If you want to edit the PyKern source code or make something out of it, Please do because it'd help a lot!
